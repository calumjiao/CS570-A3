FILE MANIFEST:
1. main.cpp
2. README.md
3. Makefile
4. Processes.cpp
5. Processes.h

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS: 
To compile the main.cpp you need to type "g++ main.cpp Processes.cpp Processes.h". This will link the files together and create the a.out file. To run the Makefile you type "make" on the command line. //////Not done

DESIGN DECISIONS: 
For this assignment, we were to implement two child processes, a clock that prints the time every second, and a countdown timer that tells the other process when to terminate and also then terminates itself. Therefore, we created a Processes class that has a run function which creates the two threads, then ///////.

We also used GitHub for version control and code collaboration, as well as Discord for communication when not meeting up in person.

LESSONS LEARNED: 
For assignment 3, we learned how to create multiple child processes that implement a timer, clock, and an alarm, and how to make a process send a signal to another in order to terminate it. Also, we have gained more practice and a better understanding the of C++ programming language.
